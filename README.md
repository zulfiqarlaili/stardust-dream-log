# Stardust Dream Log

**Capture the whispers of your subconscious before they vanish into the dawn**

Stardust Dream Log is a mystical journaling project designed to preserve the fleeting fragments of your dreams before they dissolve into the waking world. Each night, we embark on hidden journeys—vivid, surreal, and often forgotten the moment reality takes hold. But what if those dreams hold meaning? What if, by remembering them, we uncover secret pathways hidden within our own minds?

This project is an invitation to explore the ephemeral landscapes of your slumbering self. Dreams are more than fleeting illusions—they are echoes of another life, written in stardust and shadow. Yet, like sand slipping through fingers, they fade with the first light of day. Stardust Dream Log is your vessel to anchor them in memory, to decode their mysteries, and perhaps, in time, to awaken something extraordinary.

Will you remember? Will you follow the hidden path?
